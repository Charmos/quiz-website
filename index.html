						<h3>Eames Lounge Chair by Charles and Ray Eames</h3>
						<p> The instantly recognizable Eames lounge chair was designed in 1956 by husband-and-wife team Charles and Ray Eames. They did not aim to make a designer classic, their goal was to simply improve existing lounge chairs. To make a lounge chair that is
							comfortable first and foremost and one that ‘fits like a glove’ (they wanted it to have the same warm look of a baseball glove).
						</p>
						<p> Who doesn’t recognize the Eames Lounge chair? Designed by Charles and Ray Eames, it lives in museums like MOMA in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago and in stylish interiors around the world. It’s been the subject of documentaries and books.
							The quintessential modern classic.
						</p>

						<h4>Eames Chair</h4>
						<p>  Designed by Charles and Ray Eames, the Molded Plastic chairs were originally designed in metal, and entered as a prototype in MoMA’s 1948 International Competition for Low-Cost Furniture Design. Charles and Ray Eames believed that “design is a method
							of action,” and continually updated their work as new materials became available. They changed the material to fiberglass in 1950. Charles was dissatisfied with the fiberglass, and it wasn’t until after his death that the matte finish he desired
							was achieved, thanks to advances in recyclable polypropylene. “The chair that Charles and Ray were designing,” explains grandson Eames Demetrios, “is the chair that’s made tomorrow.”
						</p>
						<h4>				Egg Chair by Arne Jacobsen
		</h4>
						<p> Arne Jacobsen, however, wanted to create a chair with 1 thing in mind: a bit of privacy in public. Something we all would appreciate nowadays! The Egg chair is a chair straight outta Copenhagen, where Jacobsen designed it in 1958. It was purpose-designed
							for use in a hotel (Radisson SAS), but thanks to its iconic, unforgettable shape, it reached the masses. An instantly recognizable classic, Arne Jacobsen (again!) designed the Egg chair for the lobby and reception areas of the Royal Hotel in Copenhagen.
							This organically shaped chair has since become synonymous with Danish furniture design throughout the world. This iconic chair embraces the organic, timeless shape of one of nature’s most proportional creations. It has harmonized an aesthetic form
							without compromising comfort and functionality. Jacobsen’s influential design has been celebrated as the pioneer of modernism for more than 50 years.</p>
						<h4>Wishbone Chair by Hans Wegner</h4>
						<p>It’s one of those chairs that you cannot help but love and appreciate. Its craftsmanship and beautiful design are timeless; designed by Hans Jørgensen in 1949 and it has been in production ever since. The Wishbone chair may be one of his most famous
							chair designs. And considering the fact he designed over hundreds(!) of chairs in his lifetime, that’s saying something!</p>
						<h4>Ch88 by Hans Wegner</h4>
						<p>Wegner designed the sophisticated CH88 chair in 1955 but it was never put into production until today. It’s a bare beauty.</p>
						<h4>Paulistano chair by Paulo Mendes da Rocha</h4>
						<p>Let’s go back in time again. This time, we go back to Brazil, 1957, when Paulo Mendes da Rocha designed the Paulistano chair. Its simplicity and airiness is what makes this chair stand out from the crowd. Originally made for use in the Paulistano
							Athletics Club, Sao Paulo.</p>
						<h4>Wassily Chair by Marcel Breuer</h4>
						<p>Marcel Breuer was an apprentice at the Bauhaus when he began experimenting with tubular steel as a way of building a more transparent chair. Inspired by the frame of a bicycle, the Wassily chair is believed to be the first bent tubular steel chair
							design. It distills the traditional club chair to a series of strong, spare lines, executed with dynamic materials for its time.</p>
						Inspired by the solid, near-perfect design of bikes that hardly need any chance at all, Breuer began experimenting with bent tubular steel. And this sleek chair was the outcome.
						<h4>Panton S Chair by Verner Panton</h4>
						<p>The Panton S chair was created by Verner Panton in 1967. It was hailed as a sensation, epitomized the space age pop art of the 1960’s, and received numerous prizes. One of the earliest models is now in the collection of the MOMA in New York. Today
							the Panton S chair is regarded as a classic of modern furniture design.</p>
						<h4>Diamond Chair by Harry Bertoia</h4>
						<p>The Diamond chair was “sculpted” by Harry Bertoia using steel rods and hand welding. It features a delicate filigreed appearance that’s supremely strong. In his art, Bertoia experimented with open forms and metal work, and these chairs were an extension
							of that work. “If you look at the chairs, they are mainly made of air, like sculpture,” said Bertoia. “Space passes through them.”</p>
						Reproductions of this chair are also prohibitively expensive, which is why you don’t see as many copies floating around as the other 10 chairs on this list.
						<h4>Tulip Chair by Eero Saarinen</h4>
						<p>Similar in design to the Eames Molded Plastic chairs and Panton S chair, The Tulip chair was designed by Finnish architect and designer Eero Saarinen as a compliment to his Tulip table (Seen above). Saarinen hoped to produce the chair as a one piece
							unit made entirely of fiberglass, but the material wasn’t able to support the base, and was prone to breakage (It took another decade for Verner Panton to create the Panton S chair). As a result, the base of the Tulip chair is made of cast aluminum
							with a rilsan-coated finish to match the upper shell, giving the appearance of a single organic unit. The design was hailed as “futuristic” and was so popular that modified Tulip chairs appear on the bridge and other areas of the U.S.S. Enterprise
							(Star Trek).</p>
						<h4>Model 3107 by Arne Jacobsen</h4>
						<p>Danish architect Arne Jacobsen, designed the Model 3107 chair following the Gesamtkunstwerk ideology that the design of exterior and interior spaces should be seamlessly conceived. The 3107 along with its Series 7 siblings are Eames inspired molded
							plywood chairs. The design is so popular that it is one of the most copied chairs in the world.</p>
						<h4>Barcelona Chair by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</h4>
						<p>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona chair was originally created to furnish the German Pavilion at the International Exhibition in Barcelona. It has since come to epitomize modern design. Mies van der Rohe designed the chair to serve as seating
							for the king and queen of Spain. Sadly, it is now mostly found in office reception areas and building lobbies.</p>
						Mies van der Rohe was a modernist colossus, dominating the worlds of both architecture and furniture design. The Barcelona Chair is perhaps his most iconic furniture piece. Its design is inspired by the “X” shapes of Egyptian folding chairs and Roman
						folding stools, and was intended to elevate these humble designs into a throne worthy of royalty (it was intended for the Spanish royal family to rest their weary legs at the 1929 Barcelona Exposition). In 1930, Mies was named head of the Bauhaus,
						just before it was shut by the Nazis. It wasn’t until 1950 that he revisited the Barcelona Chair design, using updated techniques to create its cantilevered frame from a single piece of steel. This refined version was picked up by the Knoll furniture
						company and produced across the world. It’s still one of the most well-known chair designs on the planet.
						<h4>Ghost Chair by Philippe Stark</h4>
						<p>The Ghost chair, by Philippe Stark, is the reinvention of the classic Louis XV armchair using a single piece of translucent injection-molded polycarbonate. Stark took a classic form and reinvented it as a modern icon. Creating one of the most recognizable
							chairs of the 21st century.</p>
						<h4>F 51 Armchair and Sofa Suite by Walter Gropius</h4>
						<p>Walter Gropius was the founder of the Bauhaus School, and that makes him one of the grandaddies of modernist furniture. He designed the F 51 Armchair and Sofa in 1920, specifically for the director’s office at the Bauhaus – which explains its imposing
							design. Once you’ve stripped away the generous layers of padding, the F 51 is significant for its cantilevered frame, meaning the armrests float above the cushions and the bottom of the sofa doesn’t touch the ground. This offsets its weighty form,
							making this massive object appear to be levitating. The technique would go on to influence the cantilevered chair designs of Mies van der Rohe, whose work ultimately defined much of the furniture of today.</p>
						<h4>LC4 Chaise Longue by Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeannerret, Charlotte Perriand</h4>
						<p>Le Corbusier called the LC4 chaise longue a “relaxing machine.” It’s built around the idea that, with the user always at the center of modernist design principles, both form and function could be placed specifically at the service of ergonomics.
							In other words, both the LC4’s geometry and its materials were designed with one thing in mind: ultimate comfort. After its exhibition at the three designers’ Le Equipment d’une Habitation stand at the Paris Autumn Salon in 1929, the LC4 went on
							to become one of the most well-known and most desirable pieces of 20th century furniture around.</p>
						<h4>LC2 Grand Comfort by Le Corbusier</h4>
						<p>As one of the undisputed pioneers of the modernist era, Le Corbusier once said, “chairs are architecture, sofas are bourgeois.” The LC2 Grand Confort, Petit Modèle is as architecturally imposing a chair as you’re ever likely to sit on. Designed in
							1928, it’s held together by an external, tubular steel “corset,” and filled with a goose-down cushion, all resting on an L-shaped steel frame. Le Corbusier himself described it as a “basket of cushions.” The cube shape was a response to club armchair
							design, and is a masterclass in simplifying, finessing and subtracting from something until only the fundamentals remain.</p>
